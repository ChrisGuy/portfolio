## About

> I have been working in the Sports Technology space for the past 2 years. Initially within the Sales and Partnerships team and most recently in the Operations team working closely with product.

In my professional and personal life, I have always been interested in sport and programming. Which is why I have had the pleasure of working with The Hoopsfix Foundation to combine those 2 passions. We have a great community of passionate British Basketball Fans that offer so much to the development of the sport in the UK and we are trying to utilise technology to help facilitate growth at all levels.

Basketball is my top sport having played, coached and held roles as a performance analyst.
